        - __A theology of human transformation, rooted in our identity and eschatology, expressing itself in science and technology__
        - We were created to be creators. We are being transformed to become like the creative and glorified Christ. We participate in that transformation now. Science and technology are part of that creativity and transformation. Scripture and Christian tradition evoke this vision.

                - Humans were made in the image of God, intended to grow into the likeness of God
                    - Part of that image and likeness are science and technology
                        - as seen in the Garden of Eden
                        - as seen in the Ark
                        - as seen in the Tabernacle and the Temple
                - Christ embodies the likeness, and empowers us to grow into that likeness
