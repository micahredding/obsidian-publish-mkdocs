        - [[Theological Mission]]
            - to articulate the role of science and technology in the mission of God
            - to articulate the Christian story as a story of human transformation, exemplified by Christ, where science and technology are a key aspect of who we are, and who we are becoming
            - We are made to be transformed into the likeness of Christ and of God. Christ invites us to follow him in a path of love, trust, and sacrificeâ€”and through this glorification. The glory of God is exemplified in science and technology.
