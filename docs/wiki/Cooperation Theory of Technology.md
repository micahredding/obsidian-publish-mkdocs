- Technology is humble cooperation with natural creatures
    - "Creatures" include animals, vegetables, and minerals
    - Cooperating with them requires understanding them, "knowing them"
    - Knowing them requires humility, humbling ourselves before themâ€”ie, [[Science as Humility]].

    - This is supported by a reading of [[Genesis 1]]
- Thus, "[[Knowledge is Power]]"
