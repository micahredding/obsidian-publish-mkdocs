- [[Christian Transhumanist Mission]]
    - # [[Theological Mission]]
        - ### Acceptance criteria: 
            - To articulate the role of science, technology, and human transformation (__and human effort__) in the story/mission of Christ and of God.
            - To support the [[Technological Mission]], by addressing common Christian objections
            - To support the [[Faith-Renewing Mission]], by appropriating what is good, valuable, and compelling in secular transhumanism
        - ### Common Christian objections:
            - **Why transformation?** Why should we expect radically different futures, rather than God bringing an abrupt end to the human experiment, or (e.g.) preventing us from ever leaving the planet, or attaining other technological capabilities?
            - **Why science and technology?** Why should we expect to see science and technology play a significant role in the mission of God?
            - **Why human effort?** Why should we expect human efforts to succeed? Why should we expect humans might bring about the will of God in significant ways?
        - ### Aspects of Transhumanism to appropriate:
            - Visions and roadmaps to radically thriving futures
            - An appreciation for the wonders science and technology are able to accomplish
            - A call to dynamic optimism: positive, proactive action now
