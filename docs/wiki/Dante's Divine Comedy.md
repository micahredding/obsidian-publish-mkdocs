- "Words cannot tell of that transhuman change..."
    - Her eyes fast fix'd on the eternal wheels,
Beatrice stood unmov'd; and I with ken
Fix'd upon her, from upward gaze remov'd
At her aspect, such inwardly became
As Glaucus, when he tasted of the herb,
That made him peer among the ocean gods;
**Words may not tell of that transhuman change**:
And therefore let the example serve, though weak,
For those whom grace hath better proof in store
